# CSC-385_project2
The primary objective of this project is to learn how to model an interesting scene in 3D, using cube geometry and the transforms weâ€™ve learned about in class. After compiling the program, these keybindings can be used to manipulate the selected objects and camera:

KEY_ESC: Exit the program
KEY_SPACE: Cycle-select through object
KEY_R_UPPER: Rotate selected object -45 degrees about the z-axis
KEY_R_LOWER: Rotate selected object 45 degrees about the z-axis
KEY_C_LOWER: Reset the camera transform to its default position
KEY_W_LOWER: Truck camera aling the -z-axis
KEY_A_LOWER: Truck camera along the -x-axis
KEY_S_LOWER: Truck camera along the x-axis
KEY_D_LOWER: Truck camera along the z-axis
